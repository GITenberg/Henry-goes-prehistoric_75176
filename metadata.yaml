summary: '"Henry Goes Prehistoric" by W. C. Tuttle is a humorous novel written in
  the mid-20th century. The story unfolds in Wild Horse Valley and follows the escapades
  of Henry Harrison Conroy, an unlikely sheriff, as he navigates the challenges of
  crime, intrigue, and unexpected adventures amidst the rugged backdrop of Arizona
  during the gold rush era.  The narrative centers around Sheriff Henry Conroy, his
  deputy Judge Van Treece, and their inept yet endearing sidekick, the simple-minded
  Oscar Johnson. When a local prospector, Old Ben Todd, is found murdered, Henry and
  his eccentric crew dive into the mystery. The plot thickens with elements of rivalry,
  corruption, and a comedic twist as they uncover a band of high-graders led by the
  enigmatic Peter Gonyer. With a mix of whimsical characters and humorous situations,
  including a series of misadventures involving a new buckboard and various mishaps
  in Lobo Canyon, Tuttle weaves a tale that critiques the absurdity of frontier life
  while delivering suspense and laughs. Ultimately, the story addresses themes of
  friendship, ambition, and the humorous side of facing oneâ€™s fears in a chaotic world.
